# Garrett Gassensmith | Full-Stack Developer

I currently work in Northwestern IT as a Digital Media Specialist and Lead Cinematographer for our media production team and do part-time work with the Northwestern IT web team. I have experience with React, Redux, Vue, Javascript, Node, Express, HTML/CSS, MySQL, MongoDB, WordPress and many other web technologies. I take freelance development work by request and I'm looking to launch a full-time career in development!
