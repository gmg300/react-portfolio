# Garrett Gassensmith | Full-Stack Developer

I currently work in Northwestern IT as a Digital Media Specialist and Lead Cinematographer for our media production team and do part-time work with the Northwestern IT web team. I'm also learning to become a computer wizard (Full Stack Web Developer) in Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, React, Handlebars, Node, CampusPress and many other web technologies. I take freelance development work by request and I'm looking to launch a full-time career in development!
